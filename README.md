# ReversiXT Bot

This is the Bot/Client that we developed while our fourth Semester at OTH Regensburg. It
automatically plays an extended version of Reversi ("ReversiXT") on a server.

## Result

In this course there were multiple groups competing against each other. A final match was issued in
late June/August 2024, where we played against everyone. Also, a match was held against RWTH Aachen,
which also issued this course. This client won both matches.
